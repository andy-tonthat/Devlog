# Devlog
This is a repo for tracking what tasks and updates have occurred, to get in the habit of bookkeeping work I've done.
As such, no source code is stored here.

Feel free to poke around to see what I've been doing though.

In the future, these will be automatically pushed in half hour increments while source code writing.
